      "question": "What is the chemical symbol for gold?",
      "options": ["Go", "Gd", "Au", "Ag"],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Gold's chemical symbol is Au, derived from the Latin word 'aurum' meaning gold. Ag is silver (argentum), Gd is gadolinium, and Go is not a valid element symbol.",

      "question": "How many protons does a carbon atom have?",
      "options": ["4", "6", "8", "12"],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Carbon has an atomic number of 6, which means it has 6 protons in its nucleus. The atomic number always equals the number of protons.",

      "question": "What type of bond forms when electrons are shared between atoms?",
      "options": ["Ionic bond", "Covalent bond", "Metallic bond", "Hydrogen bond"],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "A covalent bond forms when two atoms share one or more pairs of electrons. Ionic bonds involve electron transfer, metallic bonds occur in metals, and hydrogen bonds are weak intermolecular forces.",

      "options": ["0", "7", "10", "14"],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "A neutral solution has a pH of 7. Solutions with pH less than 7 are acidic, and solutions with pH greater than 7 are basic (alkaline). The pH scale ranges from 0 to 14.",

      "options": ["HO", "H2O", "H2O2", "OH"],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Water's molecular formula is H2O, meaning each molecule contains 2 hydrogen atoms and 1 oxygen atom. H2O2 is hydrogen peroxide, and OH is a hydroxide ion.",
